Minnowboard
==========

This is the official source code for the [Minnowboard](http://minnowboard.org) Development Environment (MDE), 
the “core” and the libraries that are included with the [download](http://minnowboard.org/download). 

The Minnowboard development environment is based on the [Processing](http://processing.org) Development Environment (PDE).

If you have found a bug in the Minnowboard software, you can file it here under the [“issues” tab](https://github.com/minnowboard/processing/issues).

The [minnowboard-web](https://github.com/minnowboard/processing-web/) repository 
contains reference, examples, and the site. 
(Please use that link to file issues regarding the web site, the examples, or the reference.)

The instructions for building the source [are here](https://github.com/minnowboard/processing/wiki/Build-Instructions).

Someday we'll also write code style guidelines and fix all these bugs.

But in the meantime, I ask for your patience, 
[participation](https://github.com/minnowboard/processing/wiki/Project-List), 
and [patches](https://github.com/minnowboard/processing/pulls).
