Processing
==========

This is the official source code for the [Processing](http://processing.org) Development Environment (PDE), 
the “core” and the libraries that are included with the [download](http://processing.org/download). 

If you have found a bug in the Processing software, you can file it here under the [“issues” tab](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues). 
If it relates to the [JavaScript](http://processingjs.org) version, please use [their issue tracker](https://processing-js.lighthouseapp.com/).
All Android-related development has moved to its own repository [here](https://github.com/processing/processing-android), 
so issues with Android Mode, or with the Android version of the core library should be posted there instead.

The issues list has been imported from Google Code, so there are many spurious references 
amongst them since the numbering changed. Basically, any time you see references to 
changes made by [processing-bugs](https://github.com/processing-bugs), it may be somewhat suspect.
Over time this will clean itself up as bugs are fixed and new issues are added from within Github.
Help speed this process along by helping us!

The [processing-web](https://github.com/processing/processing-web/) repository 
contains reference, examples, and the site. 
(Please use that link to file issues regarding the web site, the examples, or the reference.)

The instructions for building the source [are here](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Build-Instructions).

Someday we'll also write code style guidelines, fix all these bugs, 
throw together hundreds of unit tests, and solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 

But in the meantime, I ask for your patience, 
[participation](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List), 
and [patches](https://github.com/processing/processing/pulls).
